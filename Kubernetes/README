This is the walkthrough for EKS and kubernetes cluster setup:

Pre-requisite:
An EKS cluster created with the help of Terraform OR CloudFormationTemplate in order to integrate the infrastructure as a code as a part of CICD pipeline.
A Jump server from which the yamls can be executed to create the deployment and it's supporting infrastructure and netwroks.

Information:
This deployment is configured in such a way that 'mediawiki' app can be automatically deployed as a part of CICD automation
Also this deployment is configured in such a way that when load on a application increases it will automatically scale horizontally.

Steps:
Deploy sservice.yml first in order to create the network and expose the port required by POD;
Deploy the Deployment.yml, this will create the POD in EKS cluster node with specified image 
Deploy hpa.yml in order to make this app deployment horizonatlly scalable in case of increased load.
